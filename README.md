# predictcritical

I dive into and analyse daily coal stock reports
of Indian thermal power plants for the years 2009-2012. The data is
available as part of the Republic of India’s Open Government Data
(OGD) Initiative and can be accessed at http://bit.ly/1yfkXZN or by
searching for “Coal Statement of Thermal Power Stations” at data.gov.in.

I have arranged the 48 CSV files into a continuous time series data
frame. I deal with missing,erroneous, and non-uniform data.

I use three different supervised machine learning algorithms to Forecast whether coal stocks will reach “Super-Critical” state the
following (next) day for any given power plant.
